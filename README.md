# The Problem

Sometimes you start work at a new company and the codebase is largely undocumented. Knowledge is stored in people's head instead of in the code.

Ideally, we could use code to generate documentation. This is entirely infeasible though, because documentation requires knowledge that is not present in the code.

# The Solution

Get people to write it. Shame them into it.
